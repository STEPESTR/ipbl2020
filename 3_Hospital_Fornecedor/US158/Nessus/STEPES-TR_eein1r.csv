There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.","- Increase checks_read_timeout and/or reduce max_checks.

one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was
set on 'GET' requests such that only 'authenticatedUsers' could
access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be
bypassed for the 'HEAD' version. This allowed unauthorized blind
submission of any privileged GET request.

  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for

- Providing valid credentials for all available

                This is the default welcome page used to test the correct 
                operation of the Apache2 server after installation on Ubuntu systems.
                It is based on the equivalent page on Debian, from which the Ubuntu Apache
                packaging is derived.
                If you can read this page, it means that the Apache HTTP server installed at
                this site is working properly. You should <b>replace this file</b> (located at
                <tt>/var/www/html/index.html</tt>) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.

                Configuration Overview
        </div>
        <div class=""content_section_text"">
          <p>
                Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the
                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for
                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is
                <b>fully documented in
                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz</b>. Refer to this for the full
                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be
                found by accessing the <a href=""/manual"">manual</a> if the <tt>apache2-doc</tt>
                package was installed on this server.

          </p>
          <p>
                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:
          </p>
          <pre>
/etc/apache2/
|-- apache2.conf
|       `--  ports.conf
|-- mods-enabled
|       |-- *.load
|       `-- *.conf
|-- conf-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
|-- sites-enabled
|       `-- *.conf
          </pre>
          <ul>
                        <li>
                           <tt>apache2.conf</tt> is the main configuration
                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration
                           files when starting up the web server.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           <tt>ports.conf</tt> is always included from the
                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for
                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                           Configuration files in the <tt>mods-enabled/</tt>,
                           <tt>conf-enabled/</tt> and <tt>sites-enabled/</tt> directories contain
                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration
                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.

                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be

                applications). If your site is using a web document root
                located elsewhere (such as in <tt>/srv</tt>) you may need to whitelist your
                document root directory in <tt>/etc/apache2/apache2.conf</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The default Ubuntu document root is <tt>/var/www/html</tt>. You
                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different
                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.

remote target on an available authentication protocol. Nessus was
able to connect to the remote port and identify that the service

authentication from being attempted or all of the provided credentials
for the authentication protocol may be invalid. See plugin output for
error details.

Please note the following :

- This plugin reports per protocol, so it is possible for
  valid credentials to be provided for one protocol and not
  another. For example, authentication may succeed via SSH
  but fail via SMB, while no credentials were provided for
  an available SNMP service.

- Providing valid credentials for all available
  authentication protocols may improve scan coverage, but
  the value of successful authentication for a given
  protocol may vary from target to target depending upon
  what data (if any) is gathered from the target via that
  protocol. For example, successful authentication via SSH
  is more valuable for Linux targets than for Windows
  targets, and likewise successful authentication via SMB
  is more valuable for Windows targets than for Linux
  targets.","n/a","","SSH was detected on port 22 but no credentials were provided.
